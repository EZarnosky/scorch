### This repository is not under active development.
Any issues will probably not be addressed. It is being provided as a service because CodePlex is shutting down. I found these Integration Packs useful, so I assumed other people would too.

### Available Integration Packs
A list of IPs and Utilities can be found in [The Wiki](https://github.com/sqdge/scorch/wiki)
